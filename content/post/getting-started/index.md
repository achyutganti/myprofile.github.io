## Process

1. Click on [this link](https://gitlab.com/bztsrc/usbimager). This will take you to a place called USBimager. 
2. Pick your appropriate distribution and download the file onto your local machine. It's a pretty small file so it shouldn't take that long to install.
3. Extract the files onto your local disk. 
4. Go to [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) and download the latest LTS version on your drive. But if you want to go with the non LTS-versions that's okay too. It means that you'll enjoy the bleeding edge features of the latest updates to ubuntu but will also come with the risk of bugs. 
5. Open USB imager on your PC and browse for the ubuntu file you have downloaded. 
6. Connect the USB flash drive to your computer and hit write.
7. That's it. Wait till the drive gets dedicated to the ubuntu image.
