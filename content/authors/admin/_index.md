I am a first year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at Oakland University advised by Dr. Steven Wilson. Prior to joining OU, I graduated with a masters degree in Computer Science from Grand Valley State University. 

My research intersts broadly includes natural language processing, machine learning, computational social sciences and I'm also interested in studying human behavior and how it affects natural language in everyday life.
